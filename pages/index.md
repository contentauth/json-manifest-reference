This is an experimental site. It is an incomplete work in progress and may not be accurate.

This is a reference for the [Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)](https://contentauthenticity.org/) manifest store JSON structure.  It is based on the definition of the manifest store in the [C2PA technical specification](https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/1.3/specs/C2PA_Specification.html), but is not exactly the same.  The C2PA specification defines a binary structure, but [this reference](manifest-reference) is for the JSON structure that the [CAI open source SDKs](https://opensource.contentauthenticity.org/docs/introduction) use to work with manifests.

For instructions on how to update the JSON schema used, see the README in the source repo: <https://github.com/contentauth/json-manifest-reference>.
